      "{'candidate': '.', 'context': 'The story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current brothel owner, is described as \"on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old blackguard of a woman.\" Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life. The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in Victorian Britain.Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie\\'s mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie\\'s out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.', 'metadata': {'scores': [1, 1, 1], 'source': 'backtranslation'}, 'question': 'Where does Mrs. Warren own a chain of Brothels?', 'reference': 'Europe.', 'score': 1} {'example_id': '03b295909a3f74c31b436246ea201898', 'reference': 'Europe', 'candidate': '', 'reference_tokens': ['Europe'], 'candidate_tokens': [], 'human_correctness_original': 1, 'human_correctness': 0.0, 'exact_match': 0.0, 'meteor': 0.0, 'rouge1': 0.0, 'rouge2': 0.0, 'rougeL': 0.0, 'rougeLsum': 0.0, 'bleurt': -0.4695417881011963, 'bert-score': 0.0}\n",

      "{'candidate': '.', 'context': 'The film is a semi-biographical story based upon the early life and rise to prominence of Native American dog musher George Attla, Jr. (1933–2015).  Attla, known as \"the Huslia Hustler,\" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington, who first began winning races during Attla\\'s childhood.  In recent generations, this nickname has become associated with Attla far more than with Huntington.  Attla was a leading star of the 1960s and 1970s in the sport of sprint dog sled racing.  He won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race, held in Anchorage, Alaska, 10 times between 1958 and 1982.  He also won 8 championships in the Open North American Championship race, held in Fairbanks, Alaska.  In addition, despite his mushing experience being geared more towards sprint than distance racing, Attla competed in the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973, placing fifth.  In a 2011 interview, Attla spoke of the popularity of the Iditarod, and how sprint racing \"is now a second-class sport\" as a result. The general theme of the story centered around Attla\\'s rivalry with the other leading sprint competitors of the day, fellow Alaska Native Gareth Wright (the brother of political gadfly Don Wright and grandfather of modern-day dog musher Ramy Brooks) and Massachusetts musher Roland \"Doc\" Lombard, the preparations for an upcoming big race, and his first major race victory. The movie was shot on location in Fairbanks, Alaska.

      "{'candidate': '.', 'context': \"Chris Hughes (Davis), an adopted and geeky Ohio high school senior, discovers that his recently deceased birth parents are the proprietors of a vast pornography empire and he is the inherited heir. Dropped into a bitter power struggle, his new flock of beautiful co-workers come to his aid. Chris Hughes was an outsider and geek in Ohio. He is in the middle of his senior year at high school and he is 18 years old. Chris earns extra money working on a paper route riding a moped. Right now, he would do anything to get out of here. Mostly Chris is raised by his religious parents, Carl Hughes (Dave Thomas) and Beverly Hughes (Colleen Camp). They own a grocery store, they are very strict on no drinking, smoking and no sex until you are married. They also don't tolerate porn or porno magazines, that Chris hides under his bed. His little adopted brother Danny Hughes is popular and has a better chance with a girl than Chris. Danny usually gets away with murder by his parents, mostly Chris always ends up getting in trouble. Chris is a reporter in the school newspaper, but he is a good writer. But he is always late on deadlines or dedication. He has a crush on the most popular girl Brittany Van Horn (Marnette Patterson), who is the mean girl of their school. She dreams about getting out of this town and becoming a famous actress or model. She has an entourage, too, and mostly she is dating Hudson Reed (Ryan Bittle) off and on. Hudson is the popular jock, handsome and able to get any girl he wants. Chris always wished he could be like him sometimes, he even fantasizes a lot of times, he wishes he could hook up with Brittany. It is never going to happen, as she doesn't know Chris even exists, she only dates good looking hot guys. Chris and his friends, who are nerdy perverts like Adam Torey (Charlie Talbert), Scooter (Martin Starr), Murphy (Robert Ri'chard) and Steven Chambers, are labeled as the outsiders and geeks of their high school. For once, they want to do something cool to earn a ticket to the popularity train. Chris had an idea, to throw a huge cool party at his house, while his parents out of town. They need the booze to attract the popular crowd, especially Brittany and her entourage.\", 'metadata': {'scores': [1], 'source': 'backtranslation'}, 'question': 'What grade is Chris in?', 'reference': 'Twelth Grade', 'score': 1} {'example_id': '62da259fddee833e5fab651a7c28f347', 'reference': 'Twelth Grade', 'candidate': '', 'reference_tokens': ['Twelth', 'Grade'], 'candidate_tokens': [], 'human_correctness_original': 1, 'human_correctness': 0.0, 'exact_match': 0.0, 'meteor': 0.0, 'rouge1': 0.0, 'rouge2': 0.0, 'rougeL': 0.0, 'rougeLsum': 0.0, 'bleurt': -1.411743402481079, 'bert-score': 0.0}\n",
